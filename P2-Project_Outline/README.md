## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My idea is to build a website for an apocalypse-themed restaurant called The Shelter.  The restaurant design will be like mixing a shooting gallery at an amusement park, with a lunch and dinner sit-down place to eat.  Battery powered lazer guns will be provided to people and turned on during the "Zombie Attack," which will be in intervals of 20 minutes.  The lazer guns will keep score on how many zombies were "Killed" by the person, as a fun game, with leaderboards to show who was the best.

On the website, a guest will be able to see an overview of what the restaurant is, a list of all of the menu items, reserve a table, and can order food togo.  They can also check thier high scores on the zombie attack page, and compare themselves with the all time high scores.  Admins will be able to create/change/remove menu items.
### Features
-Login page for guests and admin
-List all menu items, admin can modify, add, and remove items from the list
-Picture upload for menu items
-List of high scores that can either be sorted by personal scores or all-time scores.
-Table reservation for guests
-Online ordering for guests
### Technologies
-Java
-Bootstrap
-Thyme leaf
-some sort of picture uploading stuff?


### What I'll Have to Learn
I have no idea how to create a picture uploading box, as well as store it in a database, so I will need to look up how to do such things.
